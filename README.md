# Note Taker

## Description
This application can be used to write and save notes. Note Taker will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file (db.json).

The applicationâ€™s front end had already been created. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
